## Lets GO CAMPING!
Camp 

![Moonrise kingdom Camp example #1](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1748122/mediaviewer/rm550183680?ref_=tt_ov_mi_sm).md  I think this movies fits the description of Camp. Literally and figuratively this movie invokes the aesthetics of artifice. Muted colors and stylized shots and cinematography.

![Sharknado example #58](https://images.app.goo.gl/ozyB8drHCxgCF9UQ9).md  Sharknado is a movie with a premise that is very outlandish and nonsensical. It plays on the tropes of cinema and horror, that makes it an enjoyable watch.
